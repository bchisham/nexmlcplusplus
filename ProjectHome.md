# Summary #
This project will provide a light-weight API for importing, exporting, and modifiying  [NeXML](http://www.nexml.org/) documents using C++. It provides a set of classes that represent important constructs such as otu, network, tree, matrix, etc.  It also contain a compatibility layer to make it possible to seamlessly inter-operate with [NCL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ncl/) version 2.1 (or later). We also plan to support import and export of [CDAO](http://www.evolutionaryontology.org) files.
