An early [http://nexmlcplusplus.googlecode.com/files/NeXMLCpp-0.00000001.tar.gz release] is now available. This version has been tested
with simple NeXML documents. Those containing a single tree and matrix. Additionally
this should support networks, but that testing is still incomplete. Currently it only
support reading and writing NeXML files, manipulating data after reading or creating 
new objects and saving them is not yet supported.
